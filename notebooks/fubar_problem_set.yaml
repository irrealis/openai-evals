  ideal: |-
    \(\int \cosh x dx = \sinh x + C\). Although \(\frac{e^x}{2} - \frac{e^{-x}}{2} + C\) is an equivalent answer, it is not considered acceptable because it does not match the form of the integrand.
  rubric: |-
    - Final Answer Correctness (40 points): The final answer provided by the model matches the expert's answer in its simplest form.
      - 40: The final answer is mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer and is in its simplest form.
      - 0: The final answer is not mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer or is not in its simplest form.
    - Explanation Correctness (30 points): The explanation provided by the model to arrive at the answer is correct and logically sound.
      - 30: The explanation correctly justifies each step of the problem-solving process.
      - 15: The explanation is partially correct but does not correctly justify each step of the problem-solving process.
