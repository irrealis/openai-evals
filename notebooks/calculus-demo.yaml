    - Final Answer Correctness (50 points):
      - 50: The final answer is $\sinh x + C$.
      - 0: The final answer is not $\sinh x + C$.
    - Explanation Correctness (50 points):
      - 50: The explanation correctly states that the derivative of $\sinh x$ is $\cosh x$, so the integral of $\cosh x dx$ is $\sinh x + C$.
      - 25: The explanation is partially correct but either does not correctly identify the derivative of $\sinh x$ as $\cosh x$ or does not correctly state that the integral of $\cosh x dx$ is $\sinh x + C$.
      - 0: The explanation is incorrect or missing.

    There is little nuance in the grading of this problem, as the formula is fundamental and usually memorized as part of a standard integration table.

        The integral of $\int \cosh x dx$ can be solved by using the identity $\cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$ and then integrate term by term. This gives us the result:
        $$
        \int \cosh x dx = \frac{e^x}{2} + \frac{e^{-x}}{2} + C
        $$
        which is incorrect.

        The integral $\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2}$ can be evaluated by recognizing the form of the integrand and using the known result. This is a standard integral in calculus. The integral is equal to:

        \frac{1}{a} \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C

        The integral $\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2}$ is a common one that appears in calculus. We can solve it by using substitution. Let $u = x^2 + a^2$, then $du = 2x dx$. We can then rewrite the integral as $\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{du}{u}$, which is equal to $\frac{1}{2} \ln |u| + C$ or $\frac{1}{2} \ln |x^2 + a^2| + C$, which is incorrect.
