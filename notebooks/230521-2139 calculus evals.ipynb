    "The Model-Graded Evals is an interesting way to approach evaluating the performance of an AI model. The basic idea is to have a second model (the grader model) assess the output of the first model (the candidate model).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you would follow for your calculus problem, according to the OpenAI guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining the task: You've done this already. The task is to evaluate a certain integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Collecting comparison data: You would need a dataset of correct and incorrect responses to your integral problem. You would present the problem to a variety of models and save their responses along with the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Training a comparison model: Using the data collected in step 2, you would train a model to predict which of two responses is better. This model would take as input a problem (your integral) and two solutions, and it would output a score indicating which solution it thinks is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Grading model responses: You would then use the comparison model to grade the responses of the candidate model. You would present the problem to the candidate model, collect its response, and then present the problem and the response (along with the correct answer) to the comparison model. The comparison model's output would be the grade for the candidate model's response.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculating scores: Finally, you would calculate scores for the candidate model based on the grades from step 4. The exact method of calculating scores can vary depending on your specific needs and the nature of your task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has the advantage of being able to handle a wide variety of responses, as the comparison model is trained to evaluate responses based on their content rather than just checking for an exact match. However, it also requires a significant amount of data and computational resources to implement, as you need to train a separate comparison model for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, we could construct a rubric based on the steps of the calculation you provided. A rubric is a grading tool that explicitly describes the performance expectations for a task or piece of work. Here's a possible rubric:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Identification and Setup (20 points): The model correctly identifies the problem as a surface area of revolution calculation and sets up the integral correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Appropriate Substitution (20 points): The model correctly suggests the substitution $u = -e^{-x}$ and rewrites the integral in terms of $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integral Evaluation (20 points): The model correctly evaluates the integral $\\int_{0}^{-1} \\sqrt{1 + u^2},du$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Applying the Bounds (20 points): The model correctly applies the bounds to the evaluated integral and simplifies the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Final Simplification (20 points): The model correctly simplifies the result to obtain $\\pi (\\sqrt{2} + \\ln(1 + \\sqrt{2}))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each step of the process is worth 20 points, leading to a total score out of 100. A correct and well-explained solution would earn full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rubric would allow you to grade a model's response based on its understanding of each step in the calculation. However, this is just one way to structure a rubric. The exact design of a rubric may vary based on the specifics of your eval, your grading model, and what aspects of performance you're most interested in assessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a model-graded eval consists of several main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt: This is the task or question that is presented to the language model. In your case, the prompt is a calculus problem that the language model is asked to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target: The target is the expected response to the prompt. For your calculus problem, this would be the correct solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rubric: The rubric is a set of criteria used to evaluate the language model's response. It specifies what a good response should look like and how points are awarded for each component of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading Model: The grading model is a separate model that grades the responses of the language model. It is trained on a dataset of prompt-response pairs, along with the grades for each pair. The grading model should be able to grade new responses to the same or similar prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grades: The grades are the scores given by the grading model to the responses of the language model. They indicate how well the language model performed on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve your model-graded eval, you could consider the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve the prompt: Make sure your prompt clearly and unambiguously specifies the task that the language model is supposed to perform. If the prompt is unclear or ambiguous, the language model may not provide the type of response you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve the target: Make sure your target accurately represents the correct response to the prompt. You should also ensure that it captures all the different ways that the correct response could be expressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve the rubric: Your rubric should cover all the important aspects of a good response. It should be specific enough to guide the grading model, but flexible enough to accommodate different ways of expressing the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve the grading model: If your grading model isn't accurately grading responses, you might need to train it on more data, use a different model architecture, or tweak its training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect more data: If your grading model is having trouble generalizing to new responses, you might need to collect more data to train it on. The new data should ideally cover a wider range of responses than your current dataset.\n",
