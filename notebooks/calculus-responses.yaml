        The submission correctly notes that we can write the integrand as \(\frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}\) and then invokes the power rule of integration, which is valid for any \(n \neq -1\). This results in the expression \(\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\). However, when we apply this rule with \(n=-1\), we get \(\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C\), which is the correct answer. Thus, the submission's reasoning for evaluating the integral is technically incorrect since the power rule is valid only for \(n \neq -1\), but it does not lead to an incorrect answer.

      But the correctness of this response is arguable because in terms of the need for the absolute value, the fact that \(\frac{1}{x}\) is undefined at \(x=0\) is irrelevant. However, the the fact that \(\frac{1}{x}\) can take positive or negative values is relevant.

      We can use the fact that the derivative of $e^x$ is itself, and thus the antiderivative of $e^x$ is $e^x$. Therefore, we have
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^x + C
      \]
      where $C$ is the constant of integration.

      We can evaluate this integral using the rule for integrating exponential functions:
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C
      \]
      where C is the constant of integration. The reason for this is that the derivative of e^x with respect to x is itself (that is, d/dx e^x = e^x), so when we take the antiderivative of e^x, we end up with e^x plus a constant term.

      Therefore, we have:
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C

      We can evaluate the integral using integration by parts. Let \(u = \sin x\) and \(dv = dx\), so \(du = \cos x \, dx\) and \(v = x\). Then we have:

      \int \sin x \, dx &= -\cos x \cdot x + \int \cos x \cdot 1 \, dx \\
      &= -\cos x \cdot x + \sin x + C

      We know that the derivative of $\cos x$ is $-\sin x$, so we can use substitution to evaluate the integral. Let $u = \cos x$, then $du = -\sin x dx$. Rewriting the integral in terms of $u$ gives us:
      \[
      \int \sin x dx = -\int (-\sin x) dx = -\int du = -u + C = -\cos x + C
      \]
      where $C$ is the constant of integration.

      Therefore, $\int \sin x dx = -\cos x + C$.

The correct answer is \(-\cot x + C\), which can be obtained simply by using the power rule for integration and the trigonometric identity \(\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{1 - \sin^2 x}\): 

        \[ \int \csc^2 x dx = \int \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} dx = \int \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} dx = \int \frac{\cos^2 x}{1 - \sin^2 x} dx = -\cot x + C \]

        However, the submission's explanation did correctly use the \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) identity, and its subsequent steps were correctly derived from this starting point. Thus, I score the submission 15 points for Explanation Correctness. 

        The submission's mathematical rigor was not demonstrated in full, as it did not correctly evaluate the integral. However, the submission did use the correct identity in its initial steps, which shows some mathematical rigor. Therefore, I score the submission 10 points for Mathematical Rigor. 

        The submission did not execute any intermediate steps correctly, as its final answer was not correct. Therefore, I score the submission 0 points for Correctness of Intermediate Steps.

        The final answer provided by the model is not mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer. Instead of getting \(-\cot x + C\), the model has \[x - \cot x + C.\] Thus, the model receives 0 points for Final Answer Correctness. 

        However, the explanation provided by the model is correct and logically sound. The model correctly uses the identity \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) to rewrite the integral as \[\int \csc^2 x dx = \int (1 + \cot^2 x) dx.\] Although the model could have written \[\int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x - \ln |\csc x + \cot x| + C\] or \[\int \csc^2 x dx = -\coth^{-1}(\sin x) + C\] instead of using the identity, the model's explanation is still valid. Therefore, the model receives the full 30 points for Explanation Correctness.

        The model uses the correct mathematical identity and applies integral rules appropriately, so the model receives the full 20 points for Mathematical Rigor.

        Finally, since the model had skipped most intermediate steps, it is unclear how well the model executed each step of the problem-solving process. Thus, the model receives 0 points for Correctness of Intermediate Steps.

      We know that $\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$, so $\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}$. Thus, we can rewrite the integral as
      \[
      \int \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} dx
      \]
      Next, we use the trigonometric identity $1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x$ to rewrite the integrand as
      \[
      \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{1 + \cot^2 x}{\sin^2 x} - \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x + \cot^2 x

      Therefore, the integral becomes
      \[
      \int \csc^2 x dx + \int \cot^2 x dx
      \]
      The first integral is just $\int \csc^2 x dx$, which we know how to integrate. For the second integral, we can use the identity $\cot^2 x = \csc^2 x - 1$ to rewrite it as
      \[
      \int \cot^2 x dx = \int (\csc^2 x - 1) dx = -\cot x - x + C

      \[
      \int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x + \int \cot^2 x dx = -\cot x - x + C

        The final answer provided by the submission is incorrect. The expert's answer is \(-\csc x + C\), which is mathematically equivalent and in its simplest form. The submission's answer of \(-\frac{1}{2}\csc^2 x + C\) is not equivalent to the expert's answer since \(-\frac{1}{2}\csc^2 x\) can be simplified to \(-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x})\) which is not the same as \(-\csc x\). 

        The mathematical rigor demonstrated in the submission is sound, so I award 20 points for it. However, the explanation provided by the submission is not fully correct, and only partial credit can be awarded for it. Every step, apart from the final answer simplification, is correct. Hence, I award 15 points for the explanation provided.

        For correctness of intermediate steps, some partial credit can be given since the entire explanation is not correct. The only incorrect step is the simplification of the final answer, so I award 5 points for correctness of intermediate steps.

      We can use the substitution \(u=\cos x,\) which implies \(du=-\sin x dx.\) Therefore, we have
      \begin{align*}
          \int \sec x dx &= \int \frac{1}{\cos x} dx \\
          &= \int \frac{-\sin x}{\cos x} \frac{-1}{\sin x} dx \\
          &= \int \frac{-du}{u} \\
          &= -\ln|u| + C \\
          &= -\ln|\cos x| + C.

      We can use a substitution to evaluate this integral. Let \(u = \cos x\), so \(du = -\sin x dx\). Then we have:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \tan x dx &= \int \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}dx \\
      &= -\int \frac{-\sin x}{\cos x}dx \\
      &= -\int \frac{-du}{u} \\
      &= \ln |u| + C \\
      &= \ln |\cos x| + C.
      \end{align*}

      Therefore, \(\int \tan x dx = \ln |\cos x| + C\).

        The submission correctly identified the substitution method with u = sin(x) and correctly found du, but made an error in simplifying the integral to \[\int \frac{du/u}{u}.\] Instead, this should simplify to \[\int \frac{du}{u\sin(x)}.\] This results in the final answer of \[-\frac{1}{\sin(x)}+C,\] which is not equivalent to the expert's answer of \[\ln|\sin(x)|+C.\] Therefore, the final answer correctness score is 0.

        The submission correctly used the substitution method for integrating cot(x), but made an error in simplifying the integral. This mistake likely resulted from not cancelling out the cos(x) terms in the numerator and denominator during the substitution process.

        While the submission did not correctly simplify the integral, it demonstrated full mathematical rigor in showing each step of the process using the substitution method. Therefore, the mathematical rigor score is 20.

      We know that $\sinh x = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$, so we can substitute to get
      \[
      \int \sinh x dx = \int \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} dx

      Using the linearity of integration, we can split this into two separate integrals:
      \[
      \int \frac{e^x}{2} dx - \int \frac{e^{-x}}{2} dx

All of the substitutions are correct and the subsequent simplification of the integral using these substitutions is also correct. However, there are some minor errors in the explanation. For example, at one point, the model simplifies \(\frac{1}{a^2u^2 + a^2}\) to \(\frac{1}{a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{u^2 + 1}\) instead of \(\frac{1}{a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{u^2 + 1}\), which does not affect the final answer but is a mistake.

Additionally, there is a small error in the argument- after the second substitution, the numerator of the integrand should be \(1\), not \(1/a^2\). Although the model eventually arrives at the correct final answer, the explanation provided is not rigorous enough for a full 30 points, so I will award 20 points for explanation correctness.

      \[
      1 = A(x-a i) + B(x+ai) = (A+B)x + (B-A)ai

      Equating coefficients, we get $A+B = 0$ and $B-A = 1$. Solving for $A$ and $B$, we get $A = -\frac{1}{2ai}$ and $B = \frac{1}{2ai}$. Therefore,

      Using the substitution $u = x+ai$ for the first integral and $u = x-ai$ for the second integral, we get

      We can recognize the integrand as the derivative of the inverse sine function with the argument $x/a$. Therefore, we have:

      \[
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C
      \]

      where $C$ is the constant of integration. 

      $$ \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C $$

      We can evaluate the integral by using trigonometric substitution. Let \(x=a\sin\theta\) and \(dx=a\cos\theta\, d\theta\). Then,
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &=\int d\theta\\
      &= \theta + C\\
      &= \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C.
      \end{align*}
      Therefore, \[
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C, \quad a>0.
      \]

      The argument and final answer are correct, with the implicit understanding that \(\theta \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2)\), which is conventional in trigonometric substitution. In calculus courses the rubric often requires explicit statement of this domain, if only to get students into the habit of verifying that \(\sqrt{\cos^2 \theta\} = |\cos \theta| = \cos \theta\) on the domain.

      If the grading model has seen such a rubric in its training data, it might therefore grade this response as incorrect.
