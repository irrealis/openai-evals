      The antiderivative of $b^x$ is $\frac{b^x}{\ln b}+C$, where $\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm and $C$ is the constant of integration. We can verify this by using the chain rule and the fact that $(b^x)'= b^x \ln b$:
      \[
      \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{b^x}{\ln b} \right) = \frac{b^x \ln b}{\ln b}= b^x
      \]
      Therefore, 
      \[
      \int b^x dx = \frac{b^x}{\ln b}+C
      \]

      We can evaluate the integral using the rule:

      \[\int b^x dx = \frac{b^x}{\ln(b)} + C\]

      where C is the constant of integration. We can verify this by taking the derivative of the right-hand side to obtain:

      \[
      \begin{aligned}
      \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{b^x}{\ln(b)} + C\right) &= \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{\ln(b)} b^x\right) \\
      &= \frac{1}{\ln(b)} \cdot \frac{d}{dx} b^x \\
      &= \frac{1}{\ln(b)} \cdot b^x \cdot \ln(b) \\
      &= b^x
      \end{aligned}

      We can evaluate the integral \(\int b^x dx\) using the power rule for integration:
      \[
      \int b^x dx = \frac{b^x}{\ln(b)} + C,
      \]
      where \(C\) is the constant of integration. To derive this result, we take the derivative of the function \(\frac{b^x}{\ln(b)}\) using the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of \(\ln(b^x)\) is \(\frac{d}{dx}[\ln(b^x)] = \frac{1}{x}\):
      \begin{align*}
      \frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{b^x}{\ln(b)}\right] &= \frac{d}{dx}\left[b^x\cdot\frac{1}{\ln(b)}\right]\\

      We know that $\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$, so $\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}$. Thus, we can rewrite the integral as
      \[
      \int \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} dx
      \]
      Next, we use the trigonometric identity $1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x$ to rewrite the integrand as
      \[
      \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{1 + \cot^2 x}{\sin^2 x} - \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x + \cot^2 x

      Therefore, the integral becomes
      \[
      \int \csc^2 x dx + \int \cot^2 x dx
      \]
      The first integral is just $\int \csc^2 x dx$, which we know how to integrate. For the second integral, we can use the identity $\cot^2 x = \csc^2 x - 1$ to rewrite it as
      \[
      \int \cot^2 x dx = \int (\csc^2 x - 1) dx = -\cot x - x + C

      \int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x + \int \cot^2 x dx = -\cot x - x + C

      We use the method of substitution. Let \(u = \sin x\), then \(du = \cos x dx\). We can rewrite the integral now as
      \[
      \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \cos x dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \cos x dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{\cos x}{\cos x} dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} \cdot \cos x dx = \int \sec x \cdot \cos x dx.
      \]
      Now using the substitution \(w=\sec x\), we have \(dw=\sec x \tan x dx\), and so
      \[
      \int \sec x \cdot \cos x dx = \int \frac{1}{w} dw = \ln |w| = \ln |\sec x| + C.
      \]
      Therefore, 
      \[
      \int \sec x dx = \ln|\sec x| + C.

      We can use the substitution $u = \sec x + \tan x$, $du = (\sec x \tan x + \sec^2 x) dx$, to evaluate the integral. Rewriting $\sec x$ in terms of $\tan x$, we have

      \int \sec x dx &= \int \frac{\sec x(\sec x + \tan x) }{\sec x + \tan x} dx \\

      We can start by multiplying the numerator and denominator of $\sec x$ by $\sec x + \tan x$:

      \end{align*}
      Let $u=\cos x+\sin x$. Then $du=(-\sin x + \cos x)dx$.
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x + \sin x}dx &= -\int \frac{-\sin^2 x}{\cos x + \sin x}dx \\

      Using a substitution and integration by parts, it can be shown that $\int \frac{\cos x}{\cos x + \sin x}dx = \ln|\cos x + \sin x| + C$.

      We can use substitution to solve this integral. Let \(u = \cos x\), then \(du = -\sin x dx\). We see that \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = -\frac{du}{u}\). Therefore,
      \begin{align*}
      \int \tan x dx &= \int -\frac{du}{u} \\
      &= -\ln|\cos x| + C.

      We can evaluate this integral by using the formula for the derivative of $\sinh x$: $\frac{d}{dx} \sinh x = \cosh x$. Rewriting the integral in terms of $\sinh x$:
      \[
      \int \cosh x dx = \int \frac{d}{dx}(\sinh x) dx = \sinh x + C,
      \]
      where $C$ is the constant of integration.

      We use the definition of the hyperbolic cosine:
      \[
      \cosh x = \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}

      Thus,
      \begin{align*}
      \int \cosh x dx &= \int \frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2} dx \\

      We can start by using the substitution \(u = \frac{x}{a}\), which gives us \(du = \frac{1}{a}dx\) and \(x^2 = a^2u^2\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \int \frac{1}{a^2u^2 + a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{a} du = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du.\]
      Next, we can use the substitution \(v = u+ i\), which gives us \(du = dv\), \(u^2+1 = (v-i)^2+1 = v^2 -2iv +2\), and \(u^2 = v^2 -2iv\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{v^2+1-2iv} dv = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{(v-i)^2+1} dv.\]
      Now, we can use the substitution \(w = v-i\), which gives us \(dv = dw\) and \((v-i)^2+1 = w^2+1\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{(v-i)^2+1} dv = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{w^2+1} dw = \frac{1}{a^2}\arctan(w) + C.\]

      We can start by using partial fraction decomposition. Let
      \[
      \frac{1}{x^2+a^2} = \frac{A}{x+ai} + \frac{B}{x-ai}

      for some constants $A$ and $B$. Then we have
      \[
      1 = A(x-a i) + B(x+ai) = (A+B)x + (B-A)ai
      \]
      Equating coefficients, we get $A+B = 0$ and $B-A = 1$. Solving for $A$ and $B$, we get $A = -\frac{1}{2ai}$ and $B = \frac{1}{2ai}$. Therefore,
      \[
      \frac{1}{x^2+a^2} = -\frac{1}{2ai(x+ai)} + \frac{1}{2ai(x-ai)}

      \]
      Using the substitution $u = x+ai$ for the first integral and $u = x-ai$ for the second integral, we get

      \int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = -\frac{1}{2ai} \ln|x+ai| + \frac{1}{2ai} \ln|x-ai| + C

      The argument and final answer are correct, with the implicit understanding that \(\theta \in (-\pi/2, \pi/2)\), which is conventional in trigonometric substitution. In calculus courses the rubric often requires explicit statement of this domain, if only to get students into the habit of verifying that \(\sqrt{\cos^2 \theta\} = |\cos \theta| = \cos \theta\) on the domain.

      If the grading model has seen such a rubric in its training data, it might therefore grade this response as incorrect.

      We can use the substitution \(x=a\sin(u)\), which implies \(dx=a\cos(u)du\) and \(u=\arcsin(x/a)\). Making this substitution, we get
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &= \int \frac{a\cos(u)du}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2(u)}} \\
      &= \int \frac{a\cos(u)du}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2(u)}} \\
      &= \int \frac{du}{\cos(u)} \\
      &= \ln|\sec(u) + \tan(u)| + C \\
      &= \ln\left|\frac{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{x} + \frac{a}{x}\right| + C.
      \end{align*}
      Therefore, 
      \[
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \boxed{\ln\left|\frac{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{x} + \frac{a}{x}\right| + C}.
      \]

      We can recognize the integrand as the derivative of the inverse sine function with the argument $x/a$. Therefore, we have:

      \[
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C
      \]

      where $C$ is the constant of integration. 

      $$ \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C $$

      We can evaluate the integral by using trigonometric substitution. Let \(x=a\sin\theta\) and \(dx=a\cos\theta\, d\theta\). Then,
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &=\int d\theta\\
      &= \theta + C\\
      &= \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C.
      \end{align*}
      Therefore, \[
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C, \quad a>0.
