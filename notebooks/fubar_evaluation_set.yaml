      We have:
      \[
      \int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C
      \]
      where \(C\) is the constant of integration. This is because we can write \(\frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}\) and then use the power rule of integration, which says that
      \[
      \int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C
      \]
      for any real number \(n\neq -1\) (and where \(C\) is the constant of integration). Applying this rule with \(n=-1\) gives us the result above. 

      \[\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C\]

        The final answer provided by the model is correct and matches the expert's answer in its simplest form, so the model earns 40 points for Final Answer Correctness. 

        However, the model's explanation is incorrect in citing the power rule of integration to solve this particular integral. This results in a loss of 30 points for Explanation Correctness. 

        The model did use the correct formula to arrive at the final answer, but the explanation provided to justify each step lacks mathematical rigor. Therefore, the model earns 10 points for Mathematical Rigor. 

        Finally, the model did not correctly execute each step of the problem-solving process, as one step involved a mathematical mistake and another step relied on an inappropriate rule. This results in a loss of 0 points for Correctness of Intermediate Steps.

        The final answer provided by the submission matches the expert's answer in its simplest form, so it receives full marks for final answer correctness (40 points). 

        The submission correctly notes that we can write the integrand as \(\frac{1}{x} = x^{-1}\) and then invokes the power rule of integration, which is valid for any \(n \neq -1\). This results in the expression \(\int x^n dx = \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\). However, when we apply this rule with \(n=-1\), we get \(\int \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln|x| + C\), which is the correct answer. Thus, the submission's reasoning for evaluating the integral is technically incorrect since the power rule is valid only for \(n \neq -1\), but it does not lead to an incorrect answer. Based on this reasoning, the submission receives partial credit for explanation correctness (15 points) and mathematical rigor (10 points).

        All intermediate steps of the problem-solving process were executed correctly, so the submission receives full marks (10 points) for correctness of intermediate steps. 

        Therefore, the final score is 85.

        The final answer provided is correct and mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer in its simplest form. The explanation provided is partially correct, but incorrectly justifies each step of the problem-solving process by citing the power rule of integration, which is not applicable for \(\int \frac{1}{x} dx\). However, the submission correctly applies the substitution \(\ln|x|\) for \(\int \frac{1}{x} dx\), which is a standard method to solve this type of integral. The submission also correctly includes the constant of integration. Overall, the submission demonstrates some mathematical rigor, correctly executes the problem-solving process, but incorrectly justifies the steps taken.

        Final Answer Correctness (40 points): The submission correctly provides the answer in its simplest form that matches the expert's answer. The submission makes use of the absolute value to combine the two cases of x > 0 and x < 0, which is a valid alternative way to write the answer. Thus, the submission receives 40 points.

        Explanation Correctness (30 points): The submission presents a correct explanation of the solution process, showing the chain rule to obtain the natural logarithm from the inverse function x. The submission also justifies the use of the absolute value to combine the two cases of x > 0 and x < 0. Therefore, the submission demonstrates a logical and correct explanation, receiving full marks of 30 points.

        Mathematical Rigor (20 points): The submission shows rigor in applying the chain rule of integration, the definition of the natural logarithm, and the absolute value function. However, there is a small mathematical error by using the constant C1 for positive x and C2 for negative x instead of using a single constant C for both cases. Since the mistake is minor and does not affect the final result, the submission receives 10 points.

        Correctness of Intermediate Steps (10 points): The submission correctly executes each step of the problem-solving process, showing the use of the chain rule to integrate the function and the definition of the natural logarithm.

      We can evaluate the integral using the integration rule for exponential functions:
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C
      \]
      where C is the constant of integration. This is because the derivative of $e^{x}$ is itself:
      \[
      \frac{d}{dx} (e^{x}) = e^{x}
      \]
      Therefore, the antiderivative of $e^{x}$ is $e^{x}$. 

      Hence, 
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C

      We can evaluate the integral using integration by substitution. Let \(u = e^x\), so \(du/dx = e^x\) and \(dx = du/e^x = du/u\). Then we have:

      \int e^{x} dx &= \int u \frac{du}{u}\\
      &= \int du\\
      &= u + C\\

      We know that the integral of $\sin x$ is $-\cos x + C$ (where $C$ is the constant of integration). We can see this by differentiating $-\cos x$:
      \[
      \frac{d}{dx}(-\cos x) = \sin x

        The submission correctly identifies the method for evaluating the integral as using the reverse of the derivative of tangent, which is the derivative of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of secant. This leads to the correct answer of $\tan x + C$. However, the submission incorrectly cites the chain rule as the reasoning for using the reverse of the derivative of tangent. Therefore, the submission receives a score of 35 out of 40 for Final Answer Correctness. 

        The explanation provided by the submission is correct and logically sound, as it follows the correct method for evaluating the integral using the reverse of the derivative of tangent. The explanation also correctly justifies each step of the problem-solving process. Therefore, the submission receives a score of 30 out of 30 for Explanation Correctness. 

        The submission correctly uses the derivative of tangent and the constant of integration to arrive at the final answer. However, the correct reasoning for why the reverse of the derivative of tangent is used is due to its equivalence with the integrand, and not due to the chain rule. Therefore, the submission receives a score of 15 out of 20 for Mathematical Rigor. 

        All intermediate steps are correct, as there is only one step required to use the reverse of the derivative of tangent to evaluate the integral. Therefore, the submission receives a score of 10 out of 10 for Correctness of Intermediate Steps. 

        Overall, the submission receives a score of 90 out of 100.

        The submission correctly identifies that the integral of sec^2(x) is equal to tan(x)+C, which matches the expert answer. However, the submission incorrectly justifies this by citing the chain rule instead of integrating the derivative of tan(x). Therefore, I will give a score of 30 for Final Answer Correctness as the final answer is correct, but not mathematically rigorous.

        For Explanation Correctness, the submission provides a brief explanation but correctly justifies each step in finding the integral. Therefore, I will give a score of 30.

        The submission correctly uses the integral rule for sec^2(x) and applies the derivative rule for tan(x). Additionally, the inclusion of the constant of integration is also correct. Therefore, I will give a score of 20 for Mathematical Rigor.

        The final answer provided by the submission is incorrect, as it is not mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer or in its simplest form. Therefore, the model scores 0 points for Final Answer Correctness.

        The explanation provided by the submission is partially correct, but the model made a mistake by assuming that the identity \(\csc^2 x=1+\cot^2 x\) could be applied directly to the integral at hand. This identity applies to \(\csc^2 x\) in the context of Pythagorean trigonometric identities, but it does not lead to a simplification of the integral. Thus, the model scores 15 points for Explanation Correctness.

        The submission demonstrates some mathematical rigor by using a trigonometric identity, but it incorrectly applies the identity to the integral at hand. Therefore, the model scores 10 points for Mathematical Rigor.

        Regarding Correctness of Intermediate Steps, the submission does not have any intermediate steps that are correct. Therefore, the model scores 0 points for this category.

        Overall, the model scores 25 points for this question.

        The final answer provided by the submission is not mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer because the submission's answer includes an extra term of "x" that is not present in the expert's answer. Therefore, I score the submission 0 points for Final Answer Correctness. 

        The submission's explanation correctly starts by using the identity \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) and substituting to obtain \(\int \csc^2 x dx = \int (1 + \cot^2 x) dx\). However, the submission's next step is incorrect in stating that the integral equals \(x - \cot x + C\). The correct answer is \(-\cot x + C\), which can be obtained simply by using the power rule for integration and the trigonometric identity \(\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{1 - \sin^2 x}\): 

        \[ \int \csc^2 x dx = \int \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} dx = \int \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} dx = \int \frac{\cos^2 x}{1 - \sin^2 x} dx = -\cot x + C \]

        However, the submission's explanation did correctly use the \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) identity, and its subsequent steps were correctly derived from this starting point. Thus, I score the submission 15 points for Explanation Correctness. 

        The submission's mathematical rigor was not demonstrated in full, as it did not correctly evaluate the integral. However, the submission did use the correct identity in its initial steps, which shows some mathematical rigor. Therefore, I score the submission 10 points for Mathematical Rigor. 

        The submission did not execute any intermediate steps correctly, as its final answer was not correct. Therefore, I score the submission 0 points for Correctness of Intermediate Steps.

        The final answer provided by the model is not mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer. Instead of getting \(-\cot x + C\), the model has \[x - \cot x + C.\] Thus, the model receives 0 points for Final Answer Correctness. 

        However, the explanation provided by the model is correct and logically sound. The model correctly uses the identity \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\) to rewrite the integral as \[\int \csc^2 x dx = \int (1 + \cot^2 x) dx.\] Although the model could have written \[\int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x - \ln |\csc x + \cot x| + C\] or \[\int \csc^2 x dx = -\coth^{-1}(\sin x) + C\] instead of using the identity, the model's explanation is still valid. Therefore, the model receives the full 30 points for Explanation Correctness.

        The model uses the correct mathematical identity and applies integral rules appropriately, so the model receives the full 20 points for Mathematical Rigor.

        Finally, since the model had skipped most intermediate steps, it is unclear how well the model executed each step of the problem-solving process. Thus, the model receives 0 points for Correctness of Intermediate Steps.

        Therefore, the total score is 20 points (rounded from 25).

        The final answer provided by the submission is not mathematically equivalent to the expert's answer and is not in its simplest form (0 points). The submission correctly identified the need for substitution to solve the integral, but the expression obtained for the antiderivative is incorrect. Specifically, in the step where the integral is replaced by the integral of u du, the integration variable should be changed as well to reflect the substitution. Therefore, the integral should be expressed as:
        \[
        \int \sec x \tan x dx = \int \sec x \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} dx = -\int (-\cos x)\frac{1}{\cos x}d(\cos x) = -\int d(\cos x) = -\cos x + C
        \]
        where C is the constant of integration. 

        The explanation provided by the submission is otherwise correct and logically sound, so it receives full credit for explanation correctness (30 points). The submission demonstrates full mathematical rigor (20 points) since it correctly applies the chain rule for derivatives and the power rule for integration. Finally, since some intermediate steps are incorrect but others are correct, the submission receives partial credit for correctness of intermediate steps (5 points).

        The submission correctly uses the $u$-substitution method to simplify the given integral. However, the final answer provided by the model, $-\frac{1}{2}\csc^2x+C$, is not equivalent to the expert's answer, $-\csc x+C$, since the former can be simplified further using the Pythagorean identity $\csc^2x=1+\cot^2x$ to obtain $-\frac{1}{2}(1+\cot^2x)+C=-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}\cot^2x+C=-\left(\csc x+\frac{1}{2}\sin(2x)\right)+C$. Therefore, the final answer is not in its simplest form, and the model should receive a score of 0 for Final Answer Correctness.

        The submission provides a correct justification for using the $u$-substitution method and correctly applies the relevant derivative and integral rules. However, the explanation could be improved by explicitly stating the step of computing $du$ in terms of $dx$. Therefore, the submission demonstrates some mathematical rigor but makes minor mistakes, and the model should receive a score of 10 for Mathematical Rigor.

The submission's answer of \(-\frac{1}{2}\csc^2 x + C\) is not equivalent to the expert's answer since \(-\frac{1}{2}\csc^2 x\) can be simplified to \(-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x})\) which is not the same as \(-\csc x\).

However, the explanation provided by the submission is not fully correct, and only partial credit can be awarded for it. Every step, apart from the final answer simplification, is correct. Hence, I award 15 points for the explanation provided.

        Lastly, for Correctness of Intermediate Steps, all of the intermediate steps were correct, except for the erroneous assertion mentioned earlier. Therefore, a score of 5 points is warranted.

        Thus, the total score is \(40 + 30 + 20 + 5 = \boxed{95}\).

      We can start by using the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) to rewrite the integral as:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \csc x dx &= \int \frac{1}{\sin x} dx  
      \end{align*}
      Next, we can use the substitution \(u = \cos x, du = -\sin x dx\) to rewrite the integral as:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{1}{\sin x} dx &= -\int \frac{1}{u} du \\
      &= -\ln |u| + C \\
      &= -\ln |\cos x| + C

The expert's answer is \(\ln |\csc x-\cot x| + C\) or \(-\ln|\csc x + \cot x| + C\), while the model's answer is \(-\ln |\cos x| + C\). Therefore, the model score for final answer correctness is 0.

        The model correctly uses the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) to rewrite the integral and correctly applies the substitution \(u = \cos x, du = -\sin x dx\). However, the model's explanation is missing the step of simplifying the expression \(\ln|\csc x + \cot x|\) as \(\ln|\csc x - \cot x|\), which is necessary to understand why the expert's answer is correct. Therefore, the model score for explanation correctness is 15.

        The model demonstrates some mathematical rigor by correctly using the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and applying the substitution rule. However, the model does not show how to simplify the expression \(-\ln|\cos x|\) to arrive at the final answer. Therefore, the model score for mathematical rigor is 10.

        The submission correctly identified the substitution method with u = sin(x) and correctly found du, but made an error in simplifying the integral to \[\int \frac{du/u}{u}.\] Instead, this should simplify to \[\int \frac{du}{u\sin(x)}.\] This results in the final answer of \[-\frac{1}{\sin(x)}+C,\] which is not equivalent to the expert's answer of \[\ln|\sin(x)|+C.\] Therefore, the final answer correctness score is 0.

        The submission correctly used the substitution method for integrating cot(x), but made an error in simplifying the integral. This mistake likely resulted from not cancelling out the cos(x) terms in the numerator and denominator during the substitution process. Despite this error, the explanation is clear and shows the general steps needed to integrate cot(x). Therefore, the explanation correctness score is 15.

        While the submission did not correctly simplify the integral, it demonstrated full mathematical rigor in showing each step of the process using the substitution method. Therefore, the mathematical rigor score is 20.

        The submission made an error in simplifying the integral, but the error occurred in the last step, meaning all intermediate steps leading up to that were correct. Therefore, the correctness of intermediate steps score is 5.

      We can start by using the substitution \(u = \frac{x}{a}\), which gives us \(du = \frac{1}{a}dx\) and \(x^2 = a^2u^2\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \int \frac{1}{a^2u^2 + a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{a} du = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du.\]
      Next, we can use the substitution \(v = u+ i\), which gives us \(du = dv\), \(u^2+1 = (v-i)^2+1 = v^2 -2iv +2\), and \(u^2 = v^2 -2iv\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{v^2+1-2iv} dv = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{(v-i)^2+1} dv.\]
      Now, we can use the substitution \(w = v-i\), which gives us \(dv = dw\) and \((v-i)^2+1 = w^2+1\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{(v-i)^2+1} dv = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{w^2+1} dw = \frac{1}{a^2}\arctan(w) + C.\]
      Substituting back for \(u\) and \(v\), we get
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \frac{1}{a}\arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C.\]
      Therefore,
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{a}\arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C}.\]

        Final Answer Correctness: The final answer provided by the model matches the expert's answer in its simplest form. Therefore, the submission receives a score of 40.

        Explanation Correctness: The explanation starts by using substitution \(u = \frac{x}{a}\) and then \(v = u + i\) and \(w = v - i\). All of the substitutions are correct and the subsequent simplification of the integral using these substitutions is also correct. However, there are some minor errors in the explanation. For example, at one point, the model simplifies \(\frac{1}{a^2u^2 + a^2}\) to \(\frac{1}{a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{u^2 + 1}\) instead of \(\frac{1}{a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{u^2 + 1}\), which does not affect the final answer but is a mistake. The explanation also skips some details and jumps from one step to the next rather quickly, which can be confusing. However, overall the explanation is correct, so the submission receives a score of 15.

        Mathematical Rigor: The submission correctly uses mathematical identities (such as trigonometric substitutions) and applies integral rules (such as integration by substitution). Therefore, the submission receives a score of 20.

        Correctness of Intermediate Steps: All intermediate steps used in the solution are correct. Therefore, the submission receives a score of 10.

        The final answer provided by the model matches the expert's answer and is in its simplest form, so I will award 40 points for final answer correctness. 

        In terms of explanation correctness, the model correctly applied the substitution method and used the correct trigonometric functions for integrals of the form \(\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du\) and used the correct substitutions at each step of the way. However, it was not clearly explained why each of the substitutions were made or how they relate to solving the problem. Additionally, there is a small error in the argument- after the second substitution, the numerator of the integrand should be \(1\), not \(1/a^2\). Although the model eventually arrives at the correct final answer, the explanation provided is not rigorous enough for a full 30 points, so I will award 20 points for explanation correctness.

        In terms of mathematical rigor, the model used the correct integration techniques at each step, showing a good understanding of the subject matter. However, there were some notational errors in the argument, including an inconsistency with the expression for \(u^2\) after the second substitution. Despite these errors, the model demonstrated a general understanding of the subject matter, so I will award 15 points for mathematical rigor.

        Finally, although some steps in the argument contained errors, the majority of the intermediate steps were correct. Therefore, I will award 5 points for correctness of intermediate steps.

        Overall, the score is 80.
