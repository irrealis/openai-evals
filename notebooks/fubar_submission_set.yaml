      We can evaluate the integral using integration by substitution. Let \(u = e^x\), so \(du/dx = e^x\) and \(dx = du/e^x = du/u\). Then we have:
      \begin{align*}
      \int e^{x} dx &= \int u \frac{du}{u}\\
      &= \int du\\
      &= u + C\\
      &= e^x + C
      \end{align*}
      Therefore, \(\int e^{x} dx = e^x + C\).

      We can evaluate this integral using the rule for integrating exponential functions:
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C
      \]
      where C is the constant of integration. The reason for this is that the derivative of e^x with respect to x is itself (that is, d/dx e^x = e^x), so when we take the antiderivative of e^x, we end up with e^x plus a constant term.

      Therefore, we have:
      \[
      \int e^{x} dx = e^{x} + C
      \]

      We can evaluate this integral using integration by substitution. Let \(u = \cos x\), so \(du = -\sin x dx\). Then we have:

      \int \sin x dx &= -\int (-\sin x) dx \\
      &= -\int \frac{d}{dx}(\cos x) dx \\
      &= -\cos x + C \\
      &= -\cos(x) + C
      \end{align*}
      where \(C\) is the constant of integration. 

      Therefore, the solution to the integral \(\int \sin x dx\) is \(-\cos(x) + C\).

      We know that the derivative of $\sin x$ is $\cos x$, so we can use substitution to evaluate the integral. Let $u = \sin x$. Then $du/dx = \cos x$ and $dx = du/\cos x$. So the integral becomes
      \[
      \int \cos x dx = \int \frac{du}{\cos x} = \int \frac{du}{\sqrt{1-u^2}},
      \]
      where we used the identity $\cos^2 x = 1-\sin^2 x = 1-u^2$. We recognize the integrand as the derivative of $\arcsin u$, so we have
      \[
      \int \cos x dx = \arcsin u + C = \arcsin \sin x + C.

      We know that $\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}$, so $\csc^2 x = \frac{1}{\sin^2 x}$. Thus, we can rewrite the integral as
      \[
      \int \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} dx
      \]
      Next, we use the trigonometric identity $1 + \cot^2 x = \csc^2 x$ to rewrite the integrand as
      \[
      \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{1 + \cot^2 x}{\sin^2 x} - \frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x + \cot^2 x
      \]
      Therefore, the integral becomes
      \[
      \int \csc^2 x dx + \int \cot^2 x dx
      \]
      The first integral is just $\int \csc^2 x dx$, which we know how to integrate. For the second integral, we can use the identity $\cot^2 x = \csc^2 x - 1$ to rewrite it as
      \[
      \int \cot^2 x dx = \int (\csc^2 x - 1) dx = -\cot x - x + C
      \]
      where $C$ is an arbitrary constant of integration. Putting everything together, we have
      \[
      \int \csc^2 x dx = -\cot x + \int \cot^2 x dx = -\cot x - x + C

      \[
      \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \cos x dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \cos x dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{\cos x}{\cos x} dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} \cdot \cos x dx = \int \sec x \cdot \cos x dx.
      \]
      Now using the substitution \(w=\sec x\), we have \(dw=\sec x \tan x dx\), and so
      \[
      \int \sec x \cdot \cos x dx = \int \frac{1}{w} dw = \ln |w| = \ln |\sec x| + C.

      \[
      \int \csc x dx = \int \frac{1}{\sin x} dx.

      We can rewrite $\cot x$ as $\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}$ and use substitution. Letting $u = \sin x$, we have $du = \cos x dx$ and the integral becomes:
      \[
      \int \cot x dx = \int \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} dx = \int \frac{1}{u} du = \ln|u| + C = \boxed{\ln|\sin x| + C}

      Using the power rule of integration and the fact that the derivative of $\sinh x$ is $\cosh x$, we have:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \cosh x dx &= \int \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} dx \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} \int e^x dx + \frac{1}{2} \int e^{-x} dx \\
      &= \frac{1}{2} e^x - \frac{1}{2} e^{-x} + C
      \end{align*}
      where $C$ is the constant of integration.

      We know that $\cosh x = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$. Using this, we can integrate by substitution:

      Let $u = e^x$, then $du = e^x dx$ and thus:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \cosh x dx &= \int \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} dx \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{e^x}{e^x} dx + \frac{1}{2}\int \frac{e^{-x}}{e^x} dx \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}\int 1 dx + \frac{1}{2}\int e^{-2x} dx \\
      &= \frac{1}{2}\left(x - \frac{1}{2}e^{-2x}\right) + C
      \end{align*}

      We can start by using the substitution \(u = \frac{x}{a}\), which gives us \(du = \frac{1}{a}dx\) and \(x^2 = a^2u^2\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \int \frac{1}{a^2u^2 + a^2}\cdot \frac{1}{a} du = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du.\]
      Next, we can use the substitution \(v = u+ i\), which gives us \(du = dv\), \(u^2+1 = (v-i)^2+1 = v^2 -2iv +2\), and \(u^2 = v^2 -2iv\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{u^2+1} du = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{v^2+1-2iv} dv = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{(v-i)^2+1} dv.\]
      Now, we can use the substitution \(w = v-i\), which gives us \(dv = dw\) and \((v-i)^2+1 = w^2+1\). Substituting these into the integral, we get
      \[\frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{(v-i)^2+1} dv = \frac{1}{a^2}\int \frac{1}{w^2+1} dw = \frac{1}{a^2}\arctan(w) + C.\]
      Substituting back for \(u\) and \(v\), we get
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \frac{1}{a}\arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C.\]
      Therefore,
      \[\int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \boxed{\frac{1}{a}\arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C}.\]

      We can start by using partial fraction decomposition. Let
      \[
      \frac{1}{x^2+a^2} = \frac{A}{x+ai} + \frac{B}{x-ai}
      \]
      for some constants $A$ and $B$. Then we have
      \[
      1 = A(x-a i) + B(x+ai) = (A+B)x + (B-A)ai
      \]
      Equating coefficients, we get $A+B = 0$ and $B-A = 1$. Solving for $A$ and $B$, we get $A = -\frac{1}{2ai}$ and $B = \frac{1}{2ai}$. Therefore,
      \[
      \frac{1}{x^2+a^2} = -\frac{1}{2ai(x+ai)} + \frac{1}{2ai(x-ai)}
      \]
      and
      \[
      \int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = -\frac{1}{2ai} \int \frac{dx}{x+ai} + \frac{1}{2ai} \int \frac{dx}{x-ai}.
      \]
      Using the substitution $u = x+ai$ for the first integral and $u = x-ai$ for the second integral, we get
      \[
      \int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = -\frac{1}{2ai} \ln|x+ai| + \frac{1}{2ai} \ln|x-ai| + C
      \]
      where $C$ is a constant of integration. Therefore,
      \[
      \int \frac{dx}{x^2+a^2} = \frac{1}{2a} \ln\left|\frac{x-ai}{x+ai}\right| + C.

      We can start the problem by making the substitution \(x=a\sin\theta\), \(dx=a\cos\theta\,d\theta\). Then we have:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta\, d\theta}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2\theta}}\\
      &= \int \frac{\cos\theta}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &= \int \frac{\cos\theta}{\cos\theta}\,d\theta\\
      &= \theta + C = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C \quad \blacksquare
      \end{align*}
      \[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C\]

      We can start by using the substitution $x=a\sin(t)$, so $dx=a\cos(t)dt$ and $\sqrt{a^2-x^2} = \sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2(t)} = a\cos(t)$. Substituting, we have
      \[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \int \frac{a\cos(t)}{a\cos(t)}dt = \int dt = t + C = \sin^{-1} \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C \]
      where $C$ is the constant of integration. So we have
      \[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \boxed{\sin^{-1} \left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C}\]

      We can use the substitution \(x=a\sin\theta\), so \(dx=a\cos\theta\,d\theta\) and
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} =& \int \frac{a\cos\theta\,d\theta}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2\theta}} \\

      We can solve this integral by using the substitution \(x=a\sin\theta\). Then we have \(dx=a\cos\theta\, d\theta\) and \(\sqrt{a^2-x^2}=a\cos\theta\). Substituting these expressions, we get:
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta\,d\theta}{a\cos\theta} \\
      &= \int d\theta \\
      &= \theta + C,
      \end{align*}
      where \(C\) is the constant of integration. To find \(\theta\), we use the inverse sine function and get:
      \[\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right).\]
      Therefore, the solution to the integral is:
      \[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C.\]

      We can recognize the integrand as the derivative of the inverse sine function with the argument $x/a$. Therefore, we have:

      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C

      We can evaluate the integral by using trigonometric substitution. Let \(x=a\sin\theta\) and \(dx=a\cos\theta\, d\theta\). Then,
      \begin{align*}
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta}{\sqrt{a^2-a^2\sin^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &= \int \frac{a\cos\theta}{\sqrt{a^2\cos^2\theta}}\,d\theta\\
      &=\int d\theta\\
      &= \theta + C\\
      &= \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C.
      \end{align*}
      Therefore, \[
      \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + C, \quad a>0.
