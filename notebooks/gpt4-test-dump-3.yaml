    The area of a surface of revolution, when you're rotating the curve \(y = f(x)\), \(a \leq x \leq b\), around the x-axis is given by the formula:

    \[A = 2\pi \int_{a}^{b} y \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} dx\]

    This equation comes from summing up the surface areas of infinitesimal frustums (which are approximately cylindrical for small enough changes in \(x\)) that make up the surface.

    In our case, \(f(x) = e^{-x}\), and we're revolving about the x-axis for \(0 \leq x < \infty\). We need to compute the derivative of \(f(x)\), which is \(f'(x) = -e^{-x}\).

    Plugging these into the formula gives:

    \[A = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \sqrt{1 + \left(-e^{-x}\right)^2} dx\]

    This integral simplifies to:

    \[A = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \sqrt{1 + e^{-2x}} dx\]

    We can compute this using a u-substitution followed by a trigonometric substitution. Let \(u = e^{-x}\). Therefore \(du = -e^{-x} dx\), \(u(0)=1\), and \(\lim_{x \to \infty}u(x) = 0\).

    Now our integral is

    \[A = -2\pi \int_{1}^{0} \sqrt{1 + u^2} \du = 2\pi \int_{0}^{1} \sqrt{1 + u^2} du\]

    The presence of \(\sqrt{1 + u^2}\) suggests the trigonometric substitution \(u = \tan \theta\). Therefore \(du = \sec^2(\theta) d\theta\), \(\theta = \tan^{-1} u\), \(\theta(0) = 0\), \(\theta(1) = \pi/4\), and \(\sqrt{1 + u^2} = \sqrt{\sec^2 \theta} = |\sec \theta| = \sec \theta\) on \((0, \pi/4)\).

    Now our integral is

    \[A = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^3 \theta d\theta\]

    We can solve the indefinite integral \(\int \sec^3 \theta d\theta\) using integration by parts with \(s = \sec \theta\) and \(t = \sec^2 \theta d\theta\). Therefore \(ds = \sec \theta \tan \theta d\theta\) and \(t = \tan \theta\).

    The indefinite integral becomes

    \[\int \sec^3 \theta d\theta = \sec \theta \tan \theta - \int \sec \theta \tan^2 \theta d\theta\]

    Using the identity \(\tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta - 1\), we can write this as

    \[\int \sec^3 \theta d\theta = \sec \theta \tan \theta - \int \sec^3 \theta d\theta + \int \sec \theta d\theta\]

    We can now move \(\int \sec^3 d\theta\) from the right side to the left and divide by two:

    \[\int \sec^3 \theta d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sec \theta \tan \theta + \int \sec \theta d\theta \right)\]

    Using \(\int \sec \theta d\theta = \ln |\sec \theta + \tan \theta| + C\) we have:

    \[\int \sec^3 \theta d\theta = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sec \theta \tan \theta + \ln |\sec \theta + \tan \theta| + C \right)\]

    Our original integral becomes

    \[A = \pi \left[  \sec \theta \tan \theta + \ln |\sec \theta + \tan \theta| \right]_{0}^{\pi/4} \]

    Therefore

    \[A = \pi [\sqrt{2} + \ln(\sqrt{2} + 1)]\]

    So the area of the surface generated by revolving \(y=e^{-x}\) around the x-axis is \(\pi [\sqrt{2} + \ln(\sqrt{2} + 1)]\).

      The area of a surface of revolution, when you're rotating the curve \(y = f(x)\), \(a \leq x \leq b\), around the x-axis is given by the formula:

      \[A = 2\pi \int_{a}^{b} y \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2} dx\]

      This equation comes from summing up the surface areas of infinitesimal frustums (which are approximately cylindrical for small enough changes in \(x\)) that make up the surface.

      In our case, \(f(x) = e^{-x}\), and we're revolving about the x-axis for \(0 \leq x < \infty\). We need to compute the derivative of \(f(x)\), which is \(f'(x) = -e^{-x}\).

      Plugging these into the formula gives:

      \[A = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \sqrt{1 + \left(-e^{-x}\right)^2} dx\]

      This integral simplifies to:

      \[A = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x} \sqrt{1 + e^{-2x}} dx\]

      We can compute this using a trigonometric substitution. Let \(e^{-x} = \sinh{t}\). Therefore, \(e^{-2x} = \sinh^2{t}\), and \(dx = -\coth{t} dt\).

      Now our integral is:

      \[A = 2\pi \int_{\infty}^{0} \sinh{t} \sqrt{1 + \sinh^2{t}} (-\coth{t}) dt\]

      Simplifying \(\sqrt{1 + \sinh^2{t}}\) to \(\cosh{t}\) gives:

      \[A = -2\pi \int_{\infty}^{0} \sinh{t} \cosh{t} \coth{t} dt\]

      Using the identity \(\sinh{t}\coth{t} = \cosh{t}\), the integral simplifies to:

      \[A = -2\pi \int_{\infty}^{0} \cosh^2{t} dt\]

      We can evaluate this integral using the identity \(\cosh^2{t} = (1/2)(\cosh{2t} + 1)\). The integral of \(\cosh{2t}\) over the entire real line is zero (because it's an even function), so the integral simplifies to:

      \[A = -\pi \int_{\infty}^{0} dt\]

      This is a simple integral: the answer is \(\pi t\) evaluated from \(\infty\) to 0, which gives:

      \[A = \pi \cdot 0 - \pi \cdot \infty = -\infty\]

      This suggests that the area of the surface is infinite.

      So the area of the surface generated by revolving \(y=e^{-x}\) around the x-axis is infinite.

    Evaluate the following integral:
    \[\int \sec^3 x dx\]
    Explain your reasoning. Use LaTeX delimiters '\(' and '\)' to write your answer.
  ideal: |-
    To evaluate the integral \(\int \sec^3 x \, dx\), we can use the method of integration by parts. Let's proceed step by step:

    We start by applying the integration by parts formula:
    \[\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du\]

    In this case, we can choose \(u = \sec x\) and \(dv = \sec^2 x \, dx\).

    Differentiating \(u\) with respect to \(x\), we obtain \(du = \sec x \tan x \, dx\).
    Integrating \(dv\), we have \(\int \sec^2 x \, dx = \tan x\).

    Using the integration by parts formula, \(\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du\), we can rewrite the integral as follows:

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \int \sec^3 x \, dx &= \int u \, dv \\
    &= \sec x \tan x - \int \tan x \sec x \tan x \, dx \\
    &= \sec x \tan x - \int \sec x \tan^2 x \, dx.
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    At this point, we need to simplify the remaining integral, \(\int \sec x \tan^2 x \, dx\).

    Using the identity \(\tan^2 x = \sec^2 x - 1\), we can rewrite the integral as:

    \[
    \int \sec x \tan^2 x \, dx = \int \sec x (\sec^2 x - 1) \, dx = \int \sec^3 x \, dx - \int \sec x \, dx.
    \]

    Now, let's substitute this result back into the original equation:

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \int \sec^3 x \, dx &= \sec x \tan x - \int \sec^3 x \, dx + \int \sec x \, dx.
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    Rearranging the terms, we find:

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    2\int \sec^3 x \, dx &= \sec x \tan x + \int \sec x \, dx \\
    \int \sec^3 x \, dx &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\sec x \tan x + \int \sec x \, dx\right).
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    Now, let's evaluate the integral of \(\sec x\):

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \int \sec x \, dx &= \int \frac{1}{\cos x} \, dx \\
    &= \ln|\sec x + \tan x| + C,
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

    Finally, substituting this result back into the equation for the integral \(\int \sec^3 x \, dx\), we have:

    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \int \sec^3 x \, dx &= \frac{1}{2}\left(\sec x \tan x + \ln|\sec x + \tan x|\right) + C,
    \end{aligned}
    \]

    where \(C\) represents the constant of integration.

    Thus, the evaluated integral is:

    \[
    \int \sec^3 x \, dx = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sec x \tan x + \ln|\sec x + \tan x|\right) + C,
    \]

    where \(C\) is the constant of integration.

      To evaluate the integral \(\int \sec^3 x \, dx\), we can use the method of integration by parts. Let's proceed step by step:

      We start by applying the integration by parts formula:
      \[\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du\]

      In this case, we can choose:
      \(u = \sec^2 x\) (to differentiate)
      \(dv = \sec x \, dx\) (to integrate)

      Let's find the differentials \(du\) and \(v\):
      \(du = \frac{d}{dx}(\sec^2 x) \, dx = 2\sec x \tan x \, dx\)
      \(v = \int \sec x \, dx = \ln|\sec x + \tan x|\)

      Now, we can apply the integration by parts formula:
      \[
      \begin{aligned}
      \int \sec^3 x \, dx &= \int u \, dv \\
      &= uv - \int v \, du \\
      &= \sec^2 x \ln|\sec x + \tan x| - \int \ln|\sec x + \tan x| \cdot 2\sec x \tan x \, dx
      \end{aligned}
      \]

      Simplifying the last integral on the right-hand side, we get:
      \[
      \int \sec^3 x \, dx = \sec^2 x \ln|\sec x + \tan x| - 2\int \ln|\sec x + \tan x| \sec x \tan x \, dx
      \]

      At this point, we have a new integral to evaluate. We can proceed further by applying integration by parts again, or we can use a trigonometric identity to simplify the expression.

      Using the trigonometric identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\), we can rewrite the integral as:
      \[
      \int \sec^3 x \, dx = \sec^2 x \ln|\sec x + \tan x| - 2\int \ln|\sec x + \tan x| \cdot \frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} \, dx
      \]

      Simplifying the expression, we have:
      \[
      \int \sec^3 x \, dx = \sec^2 x \ln|\sec x + \tan x| - 2\int \frac{\sin x}{\cos^2 x} \ln|\sec x + \tan x| \, dx
      \]

      At this point, we can substitute \(u = \sec x + \tan x\) to simplify the integral further. Then, \(du = (\sec x \tan x + \sec^2 x) \, dx\), which can be rearranged to \(du = \sec x (\tan x + \sec x) \, dx\).

      Substituting these values, we have:
      \[
      \int \sec^3 x \, dx = \sec^2 x \ln|\sec x + \tan x| - 2\int \frac{\sin x}{\cos^2 x} \ln(u) \, du
      \]

      Next, we need to simplify the remaining integral. We can rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos^2 x}\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), and using the identity \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we have \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \tan x =
